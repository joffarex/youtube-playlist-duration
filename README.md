![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/youtube-playlist-duration)

Install: ```npm i -g youtube-playlist-duration```

Usage: 
- First run ```ypd-init <GOOGLE_API_KEY>```
- Then run ```ypd <PLAYLIST_ID|PLAYLIST_LINK>``` as many times as you wish
- Or in a case when you might want to list a lot of playlist durations, run ```ypd-file <PATH/TO/FILE>```, where file is populated by playlist id or link on each line.

### Development
Clone this repo and then run ```npm test``` to ensure all tests pass, then start improving my messy code. :smile:
